UI sections.png

Black section

	Visually
	The bar will display the bosses mana with numbers on top showing the exact mana

	Lua
	I will need to be able to create and destroy the bar. And Assign the bar to a unit.

Red section
	I would like this area to be modular. So up to 10 abilites can be supported.

	Visually
	Each ability needs to be stacked vertically with a timer that is able to slide out from the icon frame. Once the timer is expired it needs to slide back in.  I would also like a tooltip to show when hovering over the ability

	Lua
	I need each ability to be able to be created and destroyed as a table. Each ability should have a reference number (eg 0 - 9). Timers need to be able to be
	created and destroyed using that reference number. The only other parameter for the timer needs to be the duration.

Blue section
	Visually
	A small icon that represent a different currency.

	Lua
	I will need to be able to get the current value and set the current value

General
	I would like the hero portraits at the top, time of day, team kill numbers, glyph, quickbuy, and courior UI not shown
